        <h2>Fernando Caemerer</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Fernando, I'm from Brazil and I am 26 years old. I'm taking the Software Development BS. I like to play soccer, read, go out, and play games as hobbies. I work as a Data Engineer and I'm taking this course to keep learning and have a US degree.          
        </p>
        <p>I have been a member of the Church for 10 years. My family was founded by missionaries in 2014. My favorite quote from a church leader is "Dare to Stand Alone" from President Monson.</p>
